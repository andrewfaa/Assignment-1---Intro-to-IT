  <h1>My Profile</h1>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Andrew Faur, 3969726, s3969726@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
  <p>Hi there! I’m Andrew and I was born here in Australia, but I come from a mixed background that being – my father is Romanian and my mother is Filipino. The Romanian culture is built on the usual eastern European tradition and is very well known for its beautiful castles, one being the famous Bran Castle in Transylvania - commonly known as Dracula’s castle. Philippines on the other hand is characterised by beautiful tropical beaches and archipelagos. A great place to visit is a province called Palawan which is located in the western region of Philippines. I can speak English (of course) and a little Romanian, but never got the chance to learn Tagalog unfortunately. </p>
  <p>I completed my schooling at Woorana Park Primary School and Waverley Christian College. I went on to study a Bachelors in Computer Science at Monash, but slowly realised that I hate math with a passion which is why I transferred here at RMIT to study Information Technology. I took a gap year in between the transfer and gained a few trade qualifications while working in my father’s business as a structural steel rigger. Some hobbies of mine include soccer, snowboarding, skateboarding and camping. I love the outdoors and staying active.</p>

  <h2>Interests in IT</h2>
  <p>I first gained an interest in IT when I was 8 years old. I had my first console which was the Nintendo DS and since then I’ve been obsessed with having portable gaming devices at your fingertips. This quickly developed into a passion for having the ability to perform powerful tasks in devices with a small form factor. As a result, I am deeply interested in developing and maintaining both apps and websites suitable for everyday users.</p>
  <p>When I first started working in the trade industry as a structural steel erector in late 2019, I realised the hassle of not having any technology incorporated within our work. From having to lug around piles of detailed paper drawings to the chance of losing an important drawing and halting the construction process. These issues can be minimised with a simple piece of technology – the iPad (or tablet). Seeing how something so small can change the entire efficiency of a trade business really widened my scope on the potential impact technology can have in the lives of everyday people.</p>
  <p>Some of my experiences in IT ranged back when I was in high school where I first learnt how to code in Python. It was a computing subject that really helped me understand the fundamentals of Python. Furthermore, I began my tertiary studied doing Computer Science at Monash University, completing a semester there. During that time, I learnt more about the Python basics in detail and did a unit in 3D design. Through these experiences I can confidently say that Python feels very familiar to me, alongside basic 3D environment and character design work.</p>
  <p>After hearing from friends about how RMIT was more flexible in comparison to other universities, and not to mention its extensive international accreditation in the Information Technology field, choosing RMIT was a no brainer. RMIT is a lot more laid back in the sense that they understand you have a life outside of university. I found this approach much more appealing as I wasn’t constantly dreading the course.</p>
  <p>In my future time here at RMIT, I expect to learn the necessary skills that I can apply for future jobs in the app and website development field. I want to learn how applications are made from the coding aspects to the graphical interface that users will be using. Moreover, I want to develop my skills in Python and learn other languages such as JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Having these sorts of skills would greatly improve my appeal for companies looking app/website developers.</p>
