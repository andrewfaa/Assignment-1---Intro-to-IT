  <h1>My Profile</h1>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Andrew Faur, 3969726, s3969726@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
  <p>Hi there! I’m Andrew and I was born here in Australia, but I come from a mixed background that being – my father is Romanian and my mother is Filipino. The Romanian culture is built on the usual eastern European tradition and is very well known for its beautiful castles, one being the famous Bran Castle in Transylvania - commonly known as Dracula’s castle. Philippines on the other hand is characterised by beautiful tropical beaches and archipelagos. A great place to visit is a province called Palawan which is located in the western region of Philippines. I can speak English (of course) and a little Romanian, but never got the chance to learn Tagalog unfortunately. </p>
  <p>I completed my schooling at Woorana Park Primary School and Waverley Christian College. I went on to study a Bachelors in Computer Science at Monash, but slowly realised that I hate math with a passion which is why I transferred here at RMIT to study Information Technology. I took a gap year in between the transfer and gained a few trade qualifications while working in my father’s business as a structural steel rigger. Some hobbies of mine include soccer, snowboarding, skateboarding and camping. I love the outdoors and staying active.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Interests in IT</h2>
  <p>I first gained an interest in IT when I was 8 years old. I had my first console which was the Nintendo DS and since then I’ve been obsessed with having portable gaming devices at your fingertips. This quickly developed into a passion for having the ability to perform powerful tasks in devices with a small form factor. As a result, I am deeply interested in developing and maintaining both apps and websites suitable for everyday users.</p>
  <p>When I first started working in the trade industry as a structural steel erector in late 2019, I realised the hassle of not having any technology incorporated within our work. From having to lug around piles of detailed paper drawings to the chance of losing an important drawing and halting the construction process. These issues can be minimised with a simple piece of technology – the iPad (or tablet). Seeing how something so small can change the entire efficiency of a trade business really widened my scope on the potential impact technology can have in the lives of everyday people.</p>
  <p>Some of my experiences in IT ranged back when I was in high school where I first learnt how to code in Python. It was a computing subject that really helped me understand the fundamentals of Python. Furthermore, I began my tertiary studied doing Computer Science at Monash University, completing a semester there. During that time, I learnt more about the Python basics in detail and did a unit in 3D design. Through these experiences I can confidently say that Python feels very familiar to me, alongside basic 3D environment and character design work.</p>
  <p>After hearing from friends about how RMIT was more flexible in comparison to other universities, and not to mention its extensive international accreditation in the Information Technology field, choosing RMIT was a no brainer. RMIT is a lot more laid back in the sense that they understand you have a life outside of university. I found this approach much more appealing as I wasn’t constantly dreading the course.</p>
  <p>In my future time here at RMIT, I expect to learn the necessary skills that I can apply for future jobs in the app and website development field. I want to learn how applications are made from the coding aspects to the graphical interface that users will be using. Moreover, I want to develop my skills in Python and learn other languages such as JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Having these sorts of skills would greatly improve my appeal for companies looking app/website developers.</p>

  <h2>Ideal Job – Frontend Developer at AroFlo</h2>
  <p>Link: https://www.seek.com.au/job/57736401?type=standout#sol=7b2a1db62a10b048e8270d730030d0a394e452f0</p>
  <p>AroFlo is defines itself as a bleeding edge software company that deals with trade businesses and their transformation into digital world.  In this job advertisement, they offer a position as a frontend developer – a person who constructs websites and applications, but mainly is responsible for the user interface portion of it. What makes this position very appealing to me is the fact that it is directly involved the field I seek to be apart of – web applications.  It is also directed at assisting trade businesses which really speaks to me considering I’ve been in that industry for 3+ years.</p>
  <p>Skills/Qualifications/Experience required
The skills required for this position include:
•	Leadership skills – This position requires the ability to take leadership and accountability over projects all the way to its completion. It also mentions mentoring ‘junior team members’ in the business and building their skills.
•	Communication skills – Like many other jobs in IT, communication is a key facet when involved in team projects, mentoring and talking with clients.
•	Problem solving skills – This job advert indicates that adequate problem solving skills is required for breaking down highly difficult concepts and technical ideas.
•	Skills + experience in a plethora of coding languages – AroFlo emphasise how they value applicants with exceptional coding skills in the likes of JavaScript, NodeJS, VueJS and jQuery. In addition they expect people applying to have ‘outstanding’ skills in HTML 5, CSS, LESS/SASS.
</p>
  <p>My Skills/Qualifications/Experience
My current set of skills:
•	Leadership and communication: From being a school captain in Year 11 to taking charge in my father’s trade business, I’d say that leadership and communication are both skills I’m abundant in. The experiences I gained from guiding new students at my school as a captain can be paralleled to the job requirement of mentoring junior team members at AroFlo. Furthermore, having to take charge of my father’s rigging business while he was in Romania for a month demonstrates my competence to upkeep a team of workers and my ability to take leadership. This constitutes towards a solid set of communication skills and being able to organise people of different experiences to perform projects to its completion.
•	Some IT technical experience: Having completed a computing subject and a semester of Computer Science at Monash University, I would say I have some experience in coding in Python. This is nowhere near the extent that this job requires, but is some experience I have in the IT industry.
•	General Trade Experience: I believe my having experience in the trade industry can bring forth a new set of values not mentioned in the ad that can benefit the business. This could be in the ability to understand clients to a better degree and developing web solutions to better cater their needs.
</p>
  <p>Plan to obtain Skills/Qualifications/Experience
The overall plan to obtain the necessary IT skills for a frontend developer at AroFlo would be to complete my Bachelors of Information Technology at RMIT, specialising in app development and web systems. Having this qualification would greatly increase my skills in web development through HTML 5 and CSS which is essential for a frontend developer as their literal business is run on a web program. Moreover, gaining this degree will also teach me different coding languages such as JavaScript and also strengthen the current skills I have in Python.
After gaining my degree another stage to work my way to getting this position at AroFlo would be to gain a lower entry position in the company, such as being an intern, to further develop my experience in the IT field outside of uni. If I’m unable to get the position, another internship program at a different web system based company would suffice. Any experience in the work force would help immensly with my development in problem solving skills as I would be able to be involved hands on in real problems that I will eventually learn to resolve.
