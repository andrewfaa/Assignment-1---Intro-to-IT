  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Andrew Faur, 3969726, s3969726@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
  <p>Hi there! I’m Andrew and I was born here in Australia, but I come from a mixed background that being – my father is Romanian and my mother is Filipino. The Romanian culture is built on the usual eastern European tradition and is very well known for its beautiful castles, one being the famous Bran Castle in Transylvania - commonly known as Dracula’s castle. Philippines on the other hand is characterised by beautiful tropical beaches and archipelagos. A great place to visit is a province called Palawan which is located in the western region of Philippines. I can speak English (of course) and a little Romanian, but never got the chance to learn Tagalog unfortunately. </p>
  <p>I completed my schooling at Woorana Park Primary School and Waverley Christian College. I went on to study a Bachelors in Computer Science at Monash, but slowly realised that I hate math with a passion which is why I transferred here at RMIT to study Information Technology. I took a gap year in between the transfer and gained a few trade qualifications while working in my father’s business as a structural steel rigger. Some hobbies of mine include soccer, snowboarding, skateboarding and camping. I love the outdoors and staying active.</p>
